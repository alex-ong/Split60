Xealous - a split 60% keyboard
===

This is a simple hand-made Split60 keyboard. 
Note that i added 1mm to the middle on each half to make the magnets fit better.
You can fix this via using simple CAD tools / sketchup and re-exporting.

Required tools
===
Laser cutter Access (so you can do half-depth cuts with it)
Epoxy
Hot glue

Optional Tools - 
===
Band saw if manually assembling mid-plate.


Sandwich layers
===
* 3mm top plate (acrylic or wood)
* 18mm mid-plate (wood, needs to be filed down for ports)
* 3mm bottom-plate (acrylic or wood)

Other parts
===
10 x (5mmx1mm) Neodymium magnets
8 x (8mm x m2) screws for case
8 x (15mm x m2) female to female spacers

Top plate
===
For this, you'll need to either use a steel laser cutter/cnc, or use an acrylic laser cutter.
The files i have provided have areas in red - this represents half depth cuts.
You can use StabilizerTest.svg to try cutting stabilizers and fitting them in.
Note that when you cut, you are cutting the "bottom" of the top plate, since we need the top surface to be perfectly flush for the stabilizers to fit properly.

After you have tuned the settings for making perfect half-cuts, you can laser out the top plate.

Mid plate
===
Either get a really good laser cutter that can cut 18mm~ thick acrylic, or use wood like me, and use the half-laser files
* Laser cut half way through wood
* Use Band saw / shop tools to get rest of it
* Laser cut the middle joining area in parts
* Epoxy everything together.

Bottom plate
===
Simply cut.

Assembly
===
Screws.
